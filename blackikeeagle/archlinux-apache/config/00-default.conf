# Virtual Hosts
#
# Required modules: mod_log_config

# If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at 
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

#
# VirtualHost example:
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for all requests that do not
# match a ServerName or ServerAlias in any <VirtualHost> block.
#
<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerAdmin ike.devolder@gmail.com

	#ServerName dummy-host.example.com
	#ServerAlias www.dummy-host.example.com

	#
	# DocumentRoot: The directory out of which you will serve your
	# documents. By default, all requests are taken from this directory, but
	# symbolic links and aliases may be used to point to other locations.
	#
	DocumentRoot "/srv/http/default"
	<Directory "/srv/http/default">
		#
		# Possible values for the Options directive are "None", "All",
		# or any combination of:
		#   Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks SymLinksifOwnerMatch ExecCGI MultiViews
		#
		# Note that "MultiViews" must be named *explicitly* --- "Options All"
		# doesn't give it to you.
		#
		# The Options directive is both complicated and important.  Please see
		# http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#options
		# for more information.
		#
		Options Indexes FollowSymLinks

		#
		# AllowOverride controls what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.
		# It can be "All", "None", or any combination of the keywords:
		#   AllowOverride FileInfo AuthConfig Limit
		#
		AllowOverride None

		#
		# Controls who can get stuff from this server.
		#
		Require all granted
